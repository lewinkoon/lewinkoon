## About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m Luis, a passionate and driven mechanical engineer with a relentless curiosity for all things related to machines and technology. My journey began with a deep-seated fascination for how things work. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills, from concept to completion, in areas such as mechanical design, electronics and software development.

Outside of the engineering realm, youâ€™ll often find me exploring the latest technological advancements, tinkering with DIY projects, or indulging in outdoor adventures that provide the perfect balance to my technical pursuits.

This portfolio showcases some of the projects Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work on. Feel free to explore and get in touch if youâ€™d like to collaborate, discuss a project, or simply share your own passion for engineering. Iâ€™m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
